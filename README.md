# Daily Journal CLI Tool

I have found great benefit to journaling daily, but have always struggled with staying consistent over a long period of time, and sometimes with thinking of where to start when I first sit down to write. I find it's a great exercise towards being more mindful and helps guide my focus so that I can be more intentional with my decisions and actions on a daily basis. I have also been really interested in learning to build a CLI tool, so I took the opportunity to start a project that could get two birds stoned at once.

My goal is to create a series of prompts. One set for the morning to help set intentions for the day, and another for the evening, to reflect on wins and opportunities for growth. The responses will then be logged so users can review them at the end of the week, to notice any trends or patterns that might help guide better decisions and behaviours.
